- It contains 8 data points and 13321 features.
- The dataset includes information such as the area of the property, number of bedrooms, locality, and more.

## Machine Learning Model

- We have developed a machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict home prices.
- The model has been trained on 94.98786% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 96.475836%.
-Why is This Project Needed?
The Bangalore Home Price Prediction project addresses a critical need in the real estate market of Bangalore, India. Here are several key reasons why this project is essential:

1. Real Estate Market Dynamics
Bangalore's real estate market is characterized by its dynamic nature. Property prices can vary significantly within a short period due to factors such as economic trends, infrastructure developments, and changes in demand and supply. Accurate and up-to-date price predictions are vital for individuals looking to buy or sell property in this ever-changing market.

2. Informed Decision-Making
For prospective homebuyers, purchasing a property is a major financial decision. Predicting property prices allows buyers to make well-informed choices regarding their investment. They can better align their budget with the market rates and choose properties that suit their financial capabilities.

3. Seller's Advantage
On the other hand, sellers benefit from accurate price predictions as well. They can set competitive prices for their properties, attracting potential buyers while maximizing returns on their investments. Pricing properties correctly can reduce the time a property spends on the market.

4. Investment Opportunities
Beyond buying and selling, understanding price trends is valuable for real estate investors. Predictions can help identify areas with potential for high returns, guiding investment decisions and strategies.

5. Economic Impact
The real estate sector plays a significant role in the overall economic health of an area. Reliable price predictions contribute to market stability and help prevent speculative bubbles. This, in turn, safeguards the financial well-being of homeowners and investors alike.

6. Data-Driven Insights
In an era where data is a critical asset, leveraging machine learning to predict home prices provides data-driven insights that are more precise and efficient than traditional methods. This project harnesses the power of data to provide actionable insights for both buyers and sellers.

7. Accessibility
By making this project publicly available on GitHub, it promotes transparency and accessibility. Anyone interested in the Bangalore real estate market can utilize these predictive models and gain valuable insights into property prices.

In summary, the Bangalore Home Price Prediction project addresses the need for accurate, data-driven forecasts in a dynamic real estate market. It empowers individuals, whether they are homebuyers, sellers, or investors, to make informed decisions that align with their financial goals and market realities.
